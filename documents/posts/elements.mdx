## Paragraph

Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. We have a saboteur aboard. We know you’re dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships.

# Code

Inline `code`

Block code

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++
}

console.log(foo(5))
```

Syntax highlighting with file name, highlight line

```ts title="cores.ts"  {2}
export const cn = (classNames: ...any) => {
  return classNames.filter(Boolean).join(' ');
}
```

**Real example:**
Consider databases like Postgres. New solutions like Neon and Supabase abstract connection management, providing you with a simple way to query and mutate data. In the case of Supabase, there's a client library that uses an HTTP API [built on PostgREST](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api):

```jsx /import/#v /let/#v /{createClient}/#s /superbase/#s /{date}/#s /from/#i /createClient/#i /await/#i
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
let supabase = createClient('https://<project>.supabase.co', '<your-anon-key>')
let { data } = await supabase.from('countries').select()
```

And for Neon:

```jsx title="Neon.jsx"
import { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
let client = new Client(env.DATABASE_URL)
let {
  rows: [{ now }],
} = await client.query('select now();')
```

## math equations

The **Pythagorean equation**: $a=\sqrt{b^2 + c^2}$.

$P → Q ⟺ ~Q → ~P$

$(n + 1)^2 ≥ 2^n$
